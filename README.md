# React Native: Uninitialized State Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations like API calls.  The example showcases the error and provides a solution to prevent it.

## Problem:

The `bug.js` file contains a React Native component that fetches data asynchronously.  It attempts to access and display data from the API before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to an `undefined is not an object` error.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version.  It checks for `null` or `undefined` values before trying to access properties, preventing the error and providing a more robust solution.

## How to run:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the app.
